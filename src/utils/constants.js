    "This research project aimed to address the challenges faced by mobile map users in dynamic environments by developing and evaluating a context-aware mobile map prototype. The goal was to create a map that adapts the amount and type of information displayed based on the user's specific needs in a particular situation and to test the impact of noise level and movement speed on mobile map reading performance. To investigate the impact of contextual factors and assess the effectiveness of the adaptive map, a field-based user evaluation was conducted where participants had to solve map-related tasks in various scenarios, including walking in a park, catching public transport, and sightseeing in a city center. These scenarios exposed users to different levels of movement speed and noise.",
    'The Android mobile map application developed for this research served as a tool to answer the research questions. It was developed using Kotlin programming language and the Mapbox Maps SDK for Android was used as a mapping library for the adaptive mobile map prototype developed. Also to gather and store user evaluation data, an SQLite database was used. This database stored information related to task completion times, error rates, and user survey responses from the evaluation. All of the statistical analyses of the results were done in R programming language. Additionally, Python was used for post-processing tasks, such as data cleaning and sorting.',
    'The findings of this research demonstrate the negative impact of noise level and movement speed on mobile map reading performance and the great potential of adaptive mobile mapping in enhancing the mobile map reading process.',
